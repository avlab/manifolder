Python implementation of "Empirical Intrinsic Geometry" (EIG) code, for machine learning multivariate time-series.

The algorithm was originally described in the 2014 paper "Intrinsic modeling of stochastic dynamical systems using empirical geometry" by Talmon and Coifman) ([link to pdf](https://ronentalmon.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ACHA_EIG.pdf)), and ported to Python from the original MATLAB code, written by
